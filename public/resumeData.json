From the moment I created Hello World in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked onto software development. But software development has never been just a job for me, it's offered an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high-quality software. What started with a simple Hello World has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as time goes by. ",

        "description": "Government backed course classes at Faculty Of Electronic Engineering in Nis as a part of Junior Developer program. The program contained five modules, first one was solving algorithmic problems where I was introduced for the first time with basic programming concepts and creating simple console applications. The next module was introduction to advanced C# and Object-oriented programming paradigm, where I created a small application using Objects, Classes. Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism. The third module I liked the most, I was here introduced to JS and I simply fall in love with it. We created a simple website using HTML, CSS, JS, and also AJAX after that we converted it to the ASP.NET MVC framework. Forth module was a database, I learned here almost everything about SQL from how to create relations to writing complicated queries. In the last module, I was introduced to agile methodology, I learned about SCRUM, Kanban, and lean methodology."
